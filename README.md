In this project, I aimed to scrape all the relationships for a list of celebrities from the Who's Dated Who? website found at: https://www.whosdatedwho.com/ . Once a page was requested, the page information was added to a cache of celebrity webpages to allow for easy access in the future. I then proceeded to create a network graph to display all the relationships, where each node in the graph is a unique individual scraped from one of the requested pages. You can find the scripts mentioned above along with the final output graph.
